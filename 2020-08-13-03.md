Just have access to the site to complete the attack.
#### Affected software: NexusPHP 1.5

#### Software Download Link: http://sourceforge.net/projects/nexusphp/
  
#### Github Repository https://github.com/ZJUT/NexusPHP

##  Vulnerability details

#### fun.php
Because the author forgot to add a login check, 
the funbox page fun.php can be accessed without logging in and can publish any content.  
Since there is no login to the site, the server records an empty publisher.
Administrators can't ban publishers either.
Funbox's content is displayed on the homepage and only 1 article can be published within 24 hours.
All users will see the published content.
#### exploit:
```
